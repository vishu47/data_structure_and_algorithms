Q  : asymptotic notation and analysis
Ans : Asymptotic notation is a way to describe the running time or space complexity of an algorithm based on the input size. It is commonly used in complexity analysis to describe how an algorithm performs as the size of the input grows. The three most commonly used notations are Big O, Omega, and Theta.
f(n) = 5n^2+6n+12
time complexity is directly proportional to input data


Bubble Sort Algorithm
traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.
